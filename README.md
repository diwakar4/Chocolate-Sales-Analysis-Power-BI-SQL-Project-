Personal projects where I analyzed chocolate sales data to uncover key business insights!
Using SQL, I cleaned and structured the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Then, leveraging Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize--
 ✅ Sales performance across regions
 ✅ Top-performing products
 ✅ Monthly trends and revenue insights
 ✅ Key customer segments and purchasing patterns
